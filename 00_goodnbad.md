## Good n Bad Assignment ## 
### Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went poorly. ###
I currently am teaching a computer science ethics class for a group of high school seniors that needed an elective. 
Part of my goal for the class is to explore various interesting topics while also improving their writing skills. For the first week I covered how to make an argument. We covered
how to make a claim, explain their reasoning, and were in the middle of covering how to include evidence to support their claims. I thought it would have been a good idea to show
them how to read research articles. I was optimistic that their productive struggle would yield positive results. Unfortunately it was too far from their zone of proximal 
development. This led to a class period of confusion, struggle, and frustration.

### Why do you think it didn't go well? ###
I had never really taught 12th grade before. I had assummed their writing and reading skills would be more developed. The seniors were much more advanced in writing and reading, 
but not to the level where I needed them to be for this exercise. This error happened because I didn't measure their skills prior. If I had done some sort of check of their
prior knowledge, or assigned a writing sample, these deficiencies would become obvious. I should have not assummed their skills.

### What would you do (have you done) to make it better? ###
I would have given them two short passages that were curated with examples that can be used for evidence to support their claims. This would have allowed me to see their writing
skills in a more controlled environment, rather than letting them loose and pushing them too far to the point of frustration. I think I would introduce the idea of using research
articles as evidence much later in the year.

In addition to the ethics portion, I also teach them some basic computing skills which I know they don't have due to a survey. During one lesson we were learning how to use functions in formulas in Google Sheets. I created several scaffolded examples in which students gradually saw the importance of formulas. In one example students had to calculate the sum by hand. In the next example students had to find the sum using basic operands in Google Sheets. Finally the last worksheet involved students writing out the formula with the function SUM embedded. 

### Why do you think it went so well? ###
This worked really well because it showed them how powerful a computer can be. For my demographic of students, they are repeatedly told that computers are powerful but their use-case scenarios revolves around casual use. This exercise shows how you can add numbers in multiple ways but some ways are quicker and easier than other ways. One other reason is that my examples were scaffolded in a way which many students were able to latch onto and complete the assignment.
