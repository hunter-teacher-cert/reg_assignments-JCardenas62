# Differentiation #
    
    Three techniques I utilize to differentiate for my students are intentional groupings, think-pair-share, and intentionally designed and 
    targeted scaffolded questions. When designing my seating arrangements, I utilize class data to inform me on their performance and ability. I have my
    desks in pairs and arranged in columns. Students that sit directly adjacent to each other are homologous pairs. I do this so that when it is time to 
    have a discussion, one partner does not overshadow the other. I alternate homologous ability levels between rows. This means that one row contains a 
    homologous pairing that are beginners, while the row directly behind contains a homologous pair of intermediate/ advanced learners. I do this 
    intentionally for when they work in groups of 4, a heterogenous group is formed. I found this balance and flexibility useful. This type of grouping 
    allows struggling learners to receive help more directly from a peer in the case I cannot help the student at that time. The goal of both these types
    of grouping is to allow students to push each other's zone of proximal development during pairs, and to provide additional support for more difficult
    tasks when grouped in four.
    
    The second technique I employ for differentiation is the use of think-pair-share. I utilize think-pair-share in two different ways. The first leans more
    in favor towards verbally skilled students. Due to the demographic of students I teach, I do implement exercises where writing takes a secondary priority
    and utilize their verbal skills so that students can still engage with the content. The other form of think-pair-share I use for differentiation
    is more traditional and involves reading and writing about an article pertaining to the content. One article will be less rigorous in terms of jargon 
    and the other will be for more advanced learners. This challenges students at the level they are at, while still exposing them to the more advanced topics.
    
    The third technique I employ is the use of designated scaffolded questions. I pre-plan certain questions for particular struggling students. These questions
    allow students, who typically get lost in the lesson or have lagging skills, to participate in the class discussion thus increasing
    classroom engagement.
