# Grading Schema # 
## List_Lab ##
For this lab I would do problem 0 with them. This serves as a way to get students started. Then I would grade how far along the lab they accomplished. I would put the value of questions 1-6 15 points per question. This would lead to a maximum grade of 90. The final 10 points would be reserved for problem 7. I believe this is equitable as it allows students to still achieve a good grade for completing problems 1-6, while allowing those that want the best grade to push themselves for problem 7.
